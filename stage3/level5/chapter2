One of the key features of Bitcoin is its blockchain technology, which serves as a public ledger that records all transactions made with the currency. This distributed ledger system ensures transparency and security, as each Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing transactions to be conducted directly between users without the need for intermediaries such as banks or governments.
